;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides integration for Magit to natively interact with
;; Arcanist (https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist),
;; the CLI for Phabricator (https://phacility.com).

;;; Code:

of the command being run. Defaults to `--no-ansi' to disable

output."
